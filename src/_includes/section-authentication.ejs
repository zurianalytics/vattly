                {{apiName}} uses tokens to authenticate requests. These tokens are computed automatically by
                {{apiName}} when the page is visited.
                Tokens are loaded with time and calls when you <a class="link"
                                                                    href="#subscriptions-app">subscribe.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once a token has been loaded, it can be <a class="link" href="#manage-subscription"> managed, cancelled and
                renewed.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                To make a request, just pass the token in the query string as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                <code class="inline">https://api-url?token=<span class="accent-hard">YOUR_TOKEN</span></code>
            </p>

            <p>
                Your tokens carry many privileges, so make sure to keep them secure! Do not share your token in
                publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
            </p>
            <p>
                All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without
                authentication will also fail.
                There is a daily limit of a few unauthenticated calls.
